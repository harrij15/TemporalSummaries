# Temporal Summaries

## Framework

Our framework automatically generates a diverse set of natural language summaries of time-series data, where the linguistic structure of the summaries conform to a set of protoforms. A protoform is a template that can be used to generate a natural language statement once it is filled in with the necessary information. As an example, a simple protoform is:

On (**quantifier**) (**sub-time window**) in the past (**time window**), your (**attribute**) was (**summarizer**).
  
where summarizer is a conclusive phrase for the summary (e.g., "high", "low", etc.), and quantifier is a word or phrase that specifies how often the summarizer is true (e.g., "most", "all", etc.), given an attribute of interest.  A concrete summary following the above protoform is: “On **_most_ days** in the past **week**, your **sugar level** was **very high**.”

Our system relies on SAX representations of time-series data and temporal/sequence pattern discovery via the SPADE algorithm. SAX representations allow us to convert raw time-series data into symbolic strings containing letters of the alphabet. These representations make it easier for time-series analysis methods to find interesting patterns and anomalies efficiently in the data. Using the SPADE algorithm, we are able to discover frequent sequences, or patterns, in the data. 

## Setup
1. Set value of `attr_index` as index for the desired attribute (available attributes stored in `attributes` list)
2. Set `min_conf` (minimum confidence) and `min_sup` (minimum support) thresholds
3. Set `path` to store pattern data for cSPADE
4. Set `cygwin_path` for path to Cygwin (or equivalent) to run C++ commands
